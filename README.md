## Research
    
  - `April 2021 - April 2022` __Zhibin Wang__, Longbin Lai, Yixue Liu, Bing Shui, Chen Tian, Sheng Zhong.
    _I/O-Efficient Butterfly Counting at Scale_
    SIGMOD 23
    - Derive a new I/O lower bound of butterfly counting on hierarchical memory by proposing a new class of algorithms called the semi-witnessing algorithm.
    - Develop IOBufs algorithm that approaches the I/O lower bound.
    - Parallelize IOBufs with a fine-grained approach that carefully trade-off the the I/O-efficiency and parallelism.

  - `Nov. 2019 - Feb. 2021` Santosh Pandey, __Zhibin Wang (co-first author)__, Sheng Zhong, Chen Tian, Bolong Zheng, Xiaoye Li, Lingda Li, Adolfy Hoisie, Caiwen Ding, Dong Li, Hang Liu.
    _TRUST: Triangle Counting Reloaded on GPUs_
    TPDS
    - Implement a vertex-centric hashing-based triangle counting on GPUs with GPU-friendly hashtable layout.
    - Propose graph reordering to reduce collision in hashtable, virtual combination to balance intra-vertex workload, and degree-aware resources allocation to further reduce collision and balance inter-vertex workload.
    - Scale triangle counting to 1024 GPUs via a graph and workload collaborative partitioning.
    
  - `April 2021 - April 2022` __Zhibin Wang__, Zizhao Zhang, Ziwei Zhang, Shihui Ying, Yue  Gao, Yuan Zhang, Sheng Zhong
    _Privacy-preserving Joint Hypergraph Learning_
    Submitted to TPAMI
    - Design two protocols to help multiple parties aggregating their private hypergraph data and conduct joint hypergraph learning in a privacy-preserving manner.
    - Protocols based on light-weight cryptographic primitives, including pseudo-random number generators, sum-preserving matrix confusions, and matrix multiplication-based encryptions.


  - `June 2022 - Dec. 2022` Longbin Lai, Yufan Yang, __Zhibin Wang__, Yuxuan Liu, Haotian Ma, Sijie Shen, Bingqing Lyu, Xiaoli Zhou, Wenyuan Yu, Zhengping Qian, Chen Tian, Sheng Zhong, Yeh-Ching Chung, Jingren Zhou
    _GLogS: Interactive Graph Pattern Matching Query At Large Scale_
    Submitted to ATC 23
    - Design a compilation stack that compiles declarative GPM queries into distributed programs.
    - Propose an optimizer that can automatically derive optimal execution plans for GPM queries.
    - Implement a system that allows users to interactively submit and efficiently execute GPM queries at large scale.
